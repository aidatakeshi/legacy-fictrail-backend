# Fictional Railway Editor (Legacy Backend)

This is a legacy version of a fictional railway editor, specifically for me to fantasize an enlarged-version of Hong Kong. This backend was written with Lumen PHP framework, and is now being re-written to a new Node.js backend.

This is a discontinued project, and the codes are for studying purpose only.
